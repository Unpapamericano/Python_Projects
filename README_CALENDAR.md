Welcome to the appointment calendar project!

This project is a simple web application that allows users to view a calendar and add appointments. It is built using the Flask framework in Python and utilizes HTML and CSS for the front-end design.

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. Then, run the app locally by using python app.py. The app will be available at http://localhost:5000/.

The calendar page can be accessed at the root URL (/) and the form for adding appointments can be found at the /add route. Appointments can be added using a POST request, with the appointment details passed in the request body as form data.

Thank you for using this app! We hope it helps you stay organized and on top of your appointments.
